            This method verifies if a file exists already. If it does, it asks the user
            if it should be overwritten. If not, it gives the user an opportunity to  rename the old file.

                * So, for instance, a specific interval of 5 bases would be 
                * represented by "xxxxx". If a snp is found in the 3rd base,

            SNPfreq_form class: provides a graphical interface for the user to be able to enter

            chromosome and snp location), a file with genomic locations of interest (also
            tab separated; it should contain 4 columns: chromosome, start, end, feature id), 
            the path to the output directory (where the user would like result files to be written 
            to), the size of the window (in base-pair) where the tool will search for snps,
            and the minimum number of snps to look for in each window.
